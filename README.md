# Guess the Number Game

"Guess the Number" is a simple Java game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts. Players receive hints about whether their guess is too high or too low, and the game ends when the player correctly guesses the number or runs out of attempts.

2. The game will provide a prompt asking for the player's name. Enter your name.
3. The game will inform you that it's ready to play.
4. The program will generate a random number between 0 and 100.
5. You have a limited number of attempts (default is 5) to guess the number.
6. Enter your guess for the number when prompted.
7. You will receive hints if your guess is too high or too low.
8. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number or run out of attempts.
9. If you guess the number correctly, you win the game!
10. If you run out of attempts, the game ends, and you'll see a "GAME OVER" message.
